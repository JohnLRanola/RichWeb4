This is a web application that uses Django as a backend and React as a frontend to manage and share prescriptions between 3 users.

To use this application navigate to the backend and use these commands:

pipenv shell

cd backend

python manage.py runserver

In another terminal go to the frontend and use this command:

npm start

These two terminals should work together and a window should appear on your web browser to use this application!

Enjoy!
